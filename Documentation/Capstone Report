	Initializing the parameters for WSN creation 
	Number of nodes, BS, clusters
	Area
	Range
	Location of BS, PU’s
	Location of nodes 
	Energy initializations
	Maximum number of iterations
	Alpha, beta, rmax, packet size, epsilon, decay rate, learning rate, discount factor, state set, action set, Q table.
	Creation of clusters and CH 
	Run a loop for 1000 iterations and randomly select CHs 
	Calculate the distance between the CHs
	Select the best position to be the initial
